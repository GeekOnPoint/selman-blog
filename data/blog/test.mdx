Proposal for a Cross-Platform Water Taxi App Development
We are excited to learn about your interest in creating a cross-platform water taxi app for Ballyhoo Media, and we appreciate the opportunity to work with you on this project. Our team at Geek on Point is committed to delivering a top-quality application tailored to your needs, leveraging the latest technologies and industry best practices. Below, we have outlined the key points of our proposal.

Project Overview
Our goal is to develop a cross-platform water taxi application, similar to Uber, for the South Florida market. The application will be built using React Native for the front-end, with real-time database integration through Firebase and PostgreSQL for the backend. We will utilize bleeding-edge technologies such as Strapi headless CMS for content management and implement secure payment integrations like Apple Pay, Amazon Pay, and Shop Pay (Shopify) to ensure a seamless user experience.

Collaboration and Support
We are eager to work closely with your existing staff, including your designers (if they have UX experience) and Lead Software Engineer, Edwardt Baum. Our team will ensure a smooth collaboration process to develop a cross-platform service compatible with iOS, Android, and web platforms.

Twilio's Flex Digital Engagement Center
To provide exceptional customer service, we can integrate Twilio's Flex digital engagement center. This will enable your team to manage customer interactions throughout the entire customer journey, from initial contact to post-ride support.

Google Analytics Integration
We offer the ability of setting up high-accuracy user engagement and usage pattern monitoring through Google Analytics, providing valuable insights for your data science team to leverage. This will help you make data-driven decisions to optimize your app's performance and user experience.

Volume-Based Dynamic Pricing Algorithm
Our in-house mathematician has developed algorithms for volume-based dynamic pricing, which is ideal for a ride application. This advanced pricing model will help you maximize revenue while maintaining a competitive edge in the market.

Payment Structure
For the MVP phase, payments to Geek on Point will be divided into clear chunks, with each payment being released after specific features meet the agreed-upon acceptability criteria. We will prioritize elements that your product owners and business development team want to see first. Once the app is running in production, we offer a flat pricing of 1-2% per transaction, which will cover maintenance and support "to keep the boat afloat" (pun intended). All IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) costs for running the application will be billed separately in order to protect transparency.

In summary, we are confident in our ability to deliver a cutting-edge water taxi app that meets your requirements and exceeds your expectations. We look forward to discussing this project further and answering any questions you may have.

Please let us know the best time to schedule a call or meeting to discuss the next steps.

Sincerely,

Andy Gonzalez
Owner @ Geek on Point
